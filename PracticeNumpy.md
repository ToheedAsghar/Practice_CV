# Practice

## Question

**Q**: Perform the following
1. Split the three channels of rgb image into R,G,B.
2. Calculate threshold value by calculating mean in every channel array.
3. Apply thresholding on all the three images(R,G,B).'
4. Merge R,G,B
5. Show the results and difference.

```python

import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np

img = cv.imread('huzaifa.png')
cv.imshow('1', img)

# validation if the address is valid or not

blue = np.copy(img[:,:, 0])
green = np.copy(img[:, :, 1])
red = np.copy(img[:, :, 2])

bMean = blue.mean()
gMean = green.mean()
rMean = red.mean()

# apply threshold
rows, cols = img.shape[:2]
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        if blue[i][j] > bMean:
            blue[i][j] = 255
        else:
            blue[i][j] = 0
        if red[i][j] >= rMean:
            red[i][j] = 255
        else:
            red[i][j] = 0
        if green[i][j] >= gMean:
            green[i][j] = 255
        else:
            red[i][j] = 0

# merging channels
res = cv.merge([blue, green, red])

cv.imshow('2', res)
cv.waitKey()

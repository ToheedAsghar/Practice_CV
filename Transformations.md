# Transformations

In terms of digital Image Processing, a geometric transformation consists of two basic operations:
  1. A Spatial Transformation of Coordinates
  2. Intensity Interpolation that assigns intensity values to the spatially transformed pixels.
The transformation of coordinates may be expressed as **(x,y) = T{(v,w)}** where (v,w) are the pixel coordinates in the original image and (x,y) are the coresponding pixel coordinates in the tranformed image.

One of the most commonly used spatial coordinate transformation is the ***affine transform*** which has general form:
[x y 1] = [v w 1] **T** = [v w 1] [ [a b 0] [ c d 0] [ e f 1] ]
This tranformation can scale, rotate, translate, or sheer a set of coordinate points, depending on teh value chosen for the elements of matrix T.

## Translation

```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np

img = cv.imread('cat.jpg')
cv.imshow('Cat', img)
cv.waitKey()

def translate(img, x, y):
    translateMatrix = np.float32([[1, 0, x], [0, 1, y]])
    dimensions = (img.shape[1], img.shape[0])
    return cv.warpAffine(img, translateMatrix, dimensions)

translatedImage = translate(img, 100, 100)
cv.imshow('TranslatedCat', translatedImage)
cv.waitKey()
```

#### Importants Things to Note
- In the code above, the image is tranlated by 100 pixels on +ve x-axis and 100 pixels on -ve y-axis
  
Keep in mind the following paramters:

> **-x** for left translation

> **+x** for right translation

> **-y** for up

> **+y** for down

## Rotation

```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np

img = cv.imread('cat.jpg')
cv.imshow('Cat', img)
cv.waitKey()

def rotateImage(img, angle, rotationPoint=None):
    (height, width) = img.shape[:2]

    if rotationPoint is None:
        rotationPoint = (width//2, height//2)

    rotationMatrix = cv.getRotationMatrix2D(rotationPoint, angle, scale=1.0)
    dimensions = (width, height)

    return cv.warpAffine(img, rotationMatrix, dimensions)

rotatedImage = rotateImage(img, 90)
cv.imshow('RotatedImage', rotatedImage)
cv.waitKey()
```
- If RotationPoint is None, then the image will be rotated by center.
- scale value is set to 1.0 in order to untouch the original dimensions of the image
- image.shape returns a list of length 3, Fist is the height, second is the width and third is the number of channels. [:2] is used to extract only the first two elements (height and width) from the shape tuple.

  ## Resize
  
```python
import cv2 as cv

img = cv.imread('cat.jpg')
cv.imshow('OriginalImage', img)
cv.waitKey()

resizedImage = cv.resize(img, (500, 500))
cv.imshow('Resized_Image', resizedImage)
cv.waitKey()

w, h = 0.5, 0.5
RatioResizedImage = cv.resize(img, (0, 0), img, w, h)
cv.imshow('Ratio_Resized_Image', RatioResizedImage)
cv.waitKey()
```

- resizedImage show the resized image and new image resolution is (500, 500, 3)
- Resizing an image by ratio in OpenCV involves maintaining the aspect ratio of the image to prevent distortion. RationResizedImage does the same.

## Conclusion

- Images can be cropped using slicing
- Images can be flipped using cv2.flip(img, 0/1/-1). 0 means horizontally, 1 means vertically, -1 means both.
